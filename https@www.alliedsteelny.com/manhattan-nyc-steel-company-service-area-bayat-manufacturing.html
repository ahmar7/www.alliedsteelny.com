                                  <p class="testi-cnt">I found Bayats Manufacturing Ltd and the staff to be very accurate, with an on time delivery of the fabricated steel order. Pricing was highly competitive and I was happy to have received such excellent customer service. We highly recommend Bayat Manufacturing of Vancouver City; we now have a new steel supplier local to us in Vancouver City.</p>

One of the main priorities for this building was the height. The height had to allow for not only the entry of a high van, but also for this van to be raised on a lift in order to access and work on the underneath.</p>
                                  <p class="testi-cnt">Bayats Manufacturing Ltd provided us everything we needed, all calculations and sizing was absolutely right on the money. All the framing steel was fully galvanized as per our We selected galvanized steel for the minimal amount of maintenance for this building. The overall fabrication work was carried out to a standard befitting a quality Steel Company and its workmanship team is a testament to their overall pride and professionalism.</p>

The fabricated steel and service provided by Bayat Manufacturing was comparatively less in cost as compared other VBC Steel Companies and Fabricators.</p>
                                 <p class="testi-cnt">It has been of paramount importance to have a great working relationship with a steel company and Bayats Manufacturing Ltd has become our key steel supplier.

The old storage shed was a combination of wood and steel and suffered a complete collapse along the rear corner, weakening the rest of the structure.</p>
                                  <p class="testi-cnt">Having heard great things about Bayats Manufacturing Ltd, decided to seek their assistance in restoring the damaged shed. Our contractor was excited to work with this Vancouver City based steel company, and we went with a modified steel frame engineered to withstand the harshest of conditions including intense snow load.</p>
                                   <p class="testi-cnt">Our contractor was quite happy as all the material arrived exactly when we needed it, delivered by Bayat Manufacturing delivery trucks directly to our Long Island City location, on time, with no issues. Our contractor told us the quality of the steel was excellent and fabricated exactly as were required to achieve both the look and requirement.</p>
                                    <p class="testi-cnt">I would recommend Bayats Manufacturing Ltd Steel Fabrication Company to any company who is looking for qualitative, long-lasting and affordable steel products.</p>
