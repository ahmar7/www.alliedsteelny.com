One of the main priorities for this building was the height. The height had to allow for not only the entry of a high van, but also for this van to be raised on a lift in order to access and work on the underneath.</p>
                                  <p class="testi-cnt">Allied Steel NY provided us everything we needed, all calculations and sizing was absolutely right on the money. All the framing steel was fully galvanized as per our We selected galvanized steel for the minimal amount of maintenance for this building. The overall fabrication work was carried out to a standard befitting a quality Steel Company and its workmanship team is a testament to their overall pride and professionalism.</p>

                                 <p class="testi-cnt">Over the past few years, we have placed a number of orders from the Allied Steel NYC for a number of key projects in Queens NYC, mainly utilizing ASTM A500 & A588 for our cold storage plant located in <strong> in Brooklyn, NYC.</strong> In order to meet our specific requirements, Allied Steel NYC proved to be the best, especially from cost-effectiveness point of view. The fabricated steel and service provided by Allied Steel was comparatively less in cost as compared other NYC Steel Companies and Fabricators.</p>
                                 <p class="testi-cnt">It has been of paramount importance to have a great working relationship with a steel company and Allied Steel NYC has become our key steel supplier.

                                  <p class="testi-cnt">Having heard great things about Allied Steel NY, decided to seek their assistance in restoring the damaged shed. Our contractor was excited to work with this New York City based steel company, and we went with a modified steel frame engineered to withstand the harshest of conditions including intense snow load.</p>
                                   <p class="testi-cnt">Our contractor was quite happy as all the material arrived exactly when we needed it, delivered by Allied Steel delivery trucks directly to our Long Island City location, on time, with no issues. Our contractor told us the quality of the steel was excellent and fabricated exactly as were required to achieve both the look and requirement.</p>
                                    <p class="testi-cnt">I would recommend Allied Steel NYC Steel Fabrication Company to any company who is looking for qualitative, long-lasting and affordable steel products.</p>
